== Introduction

Expense Tracker (ET) is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for tracking their expenses. More importantly, EP is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, EP can get your expenses managed more efficiently than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!
