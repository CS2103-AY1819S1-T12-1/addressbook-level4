There are 6 main components to Expense Tracker, each highlighted by the coloured box in the diagram above.

This component is highlighted by the red box. There are two modes to this panel:

 * Expense List mode
 * Statistics Panel mode

You are able swap between Expense List mode and Statistics Panel mode by using the `list` command and
 `stats` command, respectively.

==== Expense List mode
In Expense List mode, the Left Panel displays the list of all expenses, as shown below:

.Left Panel in Expense List mode
image::userguide/expenseList.png[width="790"]

Commands that alter the Expense List, such as `find` and `list`, will change the expenses that are shown.

 See <<FindCommand, `find`>> and <<ListCommand, `list`>> commands for more details.

Each expense has an index number next to the expense name. These are relevant to the `delete` and `edit` commands.

 See <<DeleteCommand, `delete`>> and <<EditCommand, `edit`>> commands for more details.


==== Statistics Panel mode
In Statistics Panel mode, the Left Panel contains upper and lower sections, similar to what is shown below:

.Left Panel in Statistics Panel mode
image::userguide/statisticsPanel.png[width="790"]

The upper section displays statistical information about expenses.

The type of statistics shown can be changed via the `stats` command.

 See <<StatsCommand, `stats`>> command for more details.

The lower section shows four of the category budgets that have been set using the `setCategoryBudget` command.

[NOTE]
If there are no category budgets set, the lower section will be empty, save for the title.

Take note of these instructions related to the format of the commands before using them:

====
*Command Format*

* All commands begin with the command word. The command word may be followed by user-defined parameters.
* According to the format of each command, words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters which can be specified by you.
** E.g. the `login` command has the format of `login u/USERNAME` where `USERNAME` is a parameter which can be replaced by a specified value. In order to log in to an account with the username "username123", enter the command `login u/username123`.
* Parameters in square brackets are optional. This means that the parameter does not have to be included for the command to work.
** E.g if a command has a parameter format of `n/EXPENSE_NAME [t/TAG]`, the parameters can be used as `n/Birthday Present t/Girlfriend`, which includes the "Girlfriend" tag, or as `n/Birthday Present`, which does not include a tag.
* Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.
** E.g. if a command format contains the parameter `t/TAG...`, the parameter can be replaced with `t/friend` or `t/friend t/family`
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command format specifies `n/NAME c/CATEGORY`, using the parameters `c/CATEGORY n/NAME` is also acceptable.

[[SetBudgetCommand]]

exceeding the total budget that is set to prevent yourself from overspending. The warning is shown below.

[#over-budget-warning]
.Warning that is shown when a user adds an expense which results in the user exceeding the budget.
image::overbudget.png[width="300"]

Format: `setBudget MONEY_WITH_TWO_DECIMAL_PLACES`

****
*Examples:*

****

[NOTE]

* MONEY_WITH_TWO_DECIMAL_PLACES must be a positive number with two decimal places.
====

=== Setting a recurrence frequency for total budget: `setRecurrenceFrequency`
Sets the recurrence frequency for resetting the available spending of the total budget of Expense Tracker.

If you draw a salary/have an allowance, this would allow you to track the portion of money you have spent against
your salary/allowance of the week/month. This ensures that you do not overspend on a certain day, causing you to not
have enough money until you draw your next salary/allowance.

A diagram of a use case and its detailed explanation is given below:

.Diagram showing the operation of the setRecurrenceFrequency feature
image::userguide/recurrenceFrequencyGuide.png[width="500"]

. You type in the command `setRecurrenceFrequency hrs/24` as you want your available spending to reset every day
when you receive your allowance.
. You close the application.
. You reopen the application on the next day to record another expense.
. Your available spending will now be reset as it is past the set frequency of one day. A notification will be shown
to inform you that this is done.

Format: `setRecurrenceFrequency [hrs/HOURS] [min/MINUTES] [sec/SECONDS]`


****
*Examples:*

* `setRecurrenceFrequency hrs/1` +
    Sets the available spending of your total budget to reset every 1 hour
* `setRecurrenceFrequency hrs/1 min/30` +
    Sets the available spending of your total budget to reset every 1 hour and 30 minutes
****

[NOTE]
====
* The `setRecurrenceFrequency` command is case sensitive.
* HOURS/MINUTES/SECONDS must be a positive number.
* This feature does not reset all of your expenses. It just resets your available spending. Thus,
it is possible that you have 10 expenses of $200.00 with a budget of $10, and yet you are not over your budget.
====

[[SetCategoryBudgetCommand]]
=== Setting a Category Budget: `setCategoryBudget`
Sets a Budget to limit expenses on a certain category. If adding an expense causes the available spending of that
category to exceeds Category budget, a
<<over-budget-warning, warning>> will be displayed.

// end::budget[]


Format: `setCategoryBudget c/CATEGORY b/BUDGET`

****
*Example:*

* `setCategoryBudget c/School b/10.00` +
    Sets a budget of $10 for the `School` category.

****

[NOTE]
====
* The `setCategoryBudget` command is case sensitive
* `CATEOGRY` can only consist of one keyword and `BUDGET` must be a positive number with two decimal places.
* The sum of all Category budgets cannot exceed the total budget of
  Expense Tracker. This is because Category budgets are used to segment your total budget, not as a replacement.
====


=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have previously entered in reverse chronological order. +

Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
Press the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows to display the previous and next commands respectively in the command box.

Restores Expense Tracker to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +

****
*Examples:*

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +

displays a graph of your expenditure over a specified time period, in a given `MODE`. +

You can use this command to analyse your expenses, observe your spending patterns and to identify categories which take
up most of your budget.

There are two available modes: Time and Category, which can be indicated by `t` or `c` respectively in the `MODE` parameter. +

Choosing Time mode will show a bar chart, similar to the one below, in the statistics panel, where amounts for each day or month will displayed,
depending on the specified `PERIOD_AMOUNT` and `PERIOD`, starting from the current day or month. +

.Statistics Panel showing a bar chart in Time mode

Choosing Category mode will show a pie chart, similar to the one below, in the statistics panel, where amounts for each category will displayed for
expenses in the specified `PERIOD_AMOUNT` and `PERIOD`.

.Statistics Panel showing a pie chart in Category mode
image::userguide/pieChart.png[width="790"]

The available options for `PERIOD` are `d` and `m`, which represents day and month respectively. E.g. if `PERIOD_AMOUNT` is 7

== FAQ

*Q*: Do I need to manually save my data? +
*A*: There is no need to save your manually. All the data in Expense Tracker is automatically saved in the hard disk
after any command that changes the data. +


*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*:  Install the app in the other computer and copy the `data` folder in your previous Expense Tracker folder over to the new Expense Tracker folder on your other Computer.
If you wish to copy only one user over, create a folder named `data` in the app directory on the other computer and copy the xml file with your username in the `data` folder of the old computer into the `data` folder of the new computer.

//tag::dataencryption[]

*Q*: How is my expense data kept safe when I use this application? +
*A*: All user expense-specific data is encrypted. The program ensures that no one will be able to decrypt encrypted information without your actual plain text password, which is not stored anywhere. So rest assured that no one can access your data without your password.

*Q*: How do I manually encrypt text to edit my user XML file as a technologically-savvy user? +
*A*: You can make use of the encrypt and decrypt commands that have been described in the previous section.
