=== Overview

This portfolio aims to document the contributions made by *Jonathan Tan Jit Ming* to the *Expense Tracker*.

*Expense Tracker* was a project done under the a Software Engineering module during my time at NUS. The project involved
working in a team of 5 people to enhance or morph an existing https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[Address Book]
application. +

*Expense Tracker* is a desktop application that can be used track one's expenses and features a Command Line Interface (CLI)
as the main mode of interaction. Expense Tracker aims to provide users with the necessary tools to become
a better saver. The main features of *Expense Tracker* are the managing of expenses, budget setting and expense statistics.

=== Summary of contributions

*Code Contribution* -- Refer to this https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=jonathantjm[link] to see
the code I contributed to Expense Tracker.

Below describes my contributions and enhancements to Expense Tracker and the project team:

==== Main feature
The main feature that I added was the functionality to display *expense statistics*, which is a bar chart or a pie chart
showing the user's expenditure organised by time or category. This is a core feature of Expense Tracker as it allows the user to be informed about their spending patterns, and therefore helping the user become a better saver. +

This feature required an in-depth understanding of the software architecture as it involves multiple components of the application.

==== Other Contributions

These are other contributions that I made to the project and the team:

//. Added a `Date` class that is used to represent the date of an expense.

. Ensured consistency in the language, formatting and structure of the project's documentation. These changes can be seen in Pull Requests (PRs)
