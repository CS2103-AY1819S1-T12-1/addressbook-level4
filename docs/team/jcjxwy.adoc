== PROJECT: ExpenseTracker

== Overview

This portfolio aims to document my role and contribution to the *ExpenseTracker*.

*ExpenseTracker* is a desktop application used for tracking user's expenses.
The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI),
and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 28 kLoC.
It is the product of CS2103T team project.

The main purpose of this project is to morph AddressBook - Level 4,
a given desktop application, into any new application. We work as a team of 5.

Some of the main features of *ExpenseTracker* are:

. Setting a budget for expenses.
. Multiple user accounts.
. Categorization of expenses.
. Statistics for expenses.

== Summary of contributions
This section summarizes my contribution to the project.

* *Major enhancement:*
** Added the ability to find and edit multiple expenses by specific keywords
*** What it does: Allow user to filter out the particular expenses by entering relevant keywords. Allow user to edit
all targeted expenses at the same time.
*** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because now it is more convenient for user to find and edit particular expenses.
Now users can easily view the list of expenses with desired details, for example,specific name, category, cost and date.
With mass edit, users can easily correct the wrongly recorded expenses.
*** Highlights: This feature enhances the original filtering function. This makes the application more user-friendly as
filtering is one of the most frequently used commands in this application.

* *Minor enhancement:*
** Refactored original `AddressBook` and `Person` class into `ExpenseTracker` and `Expense` class.
** Updated sample entries.
** Modified the original `UniquePersonList` into `ExpenseList` to allow for duplicate `Expense`.
