== PROJECT: ExpenseTracker

---

== Overview

*Expense Tracker* is the secure, efficient financial application for the keyboard enthusiast. Boasting such features as daily tips,
statistics, expense management and budget setting, *Expense Tracker* equips users with the necessary tools to become a better saver.

Morphed from the https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[Address Book] application,
**Expense Tracker** was developed for an NUS Software Engineering module (CS2103T) under several https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-website/admin/project-constraints.html[constraints].
Due to said constraints, Command Line Interface (CLI) became the main mode of interaction with the application. However, to ensure user friendliness, a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been implemented.

This portfolio is a documentation of my contributions to *Expense Tracker*.

== Summary of contributions

*Major Enhancement:* Implementation of GUI elements for newly added features

*What It Does*

* Displays the user's expenditure information on the GUI. This includes their notifications, monthly budget, monthly expenses and budgets for categories.
The Notification System in particular was entirely implemented by me. The feature generates and displays daily saving tips and warnings
if the user is about to spend or have spent over their budget.

*Justification*

* A well-designed and responsive user interface is able to maximize user experience and allows *Expense Tracker* to stand out amongst the sea
of financial applications.

* I predict that there will be a subset of users who use *Expense Tracker* because they have trouble maintaining a budget. The Notification System was
 implemented to help said users by monitoring their budget management and providing general knowledge about saving money.

*Highlights*

* Creativity and many design considerations were required to get the *Expense Tracker* GUI to look and function as I had envisioned.
* Additional features animation and dynamic changing of text color were also implemented for the GUI for improved visual feedback.
* The implementation of the Notification System, in particular, was challenging as it involved making additions and modifications to all components of *Expense Tracker*.

*Minor enhancements*:

* Implemented the `notification` command which allows users to toggle the option for automated notification sending.
* Completely overhauled the CSS styling of the application.
* Implemented other minor animations to existing features such a fade-in effect of GUI elements upon login.
* Added color to `Tags`.
